# shiftlines
shiftlines is a very simple php app that shows the weekly work scheduals of small teams. I wrote to replace an old excel spreadsheet that we were using at work. It has some obvious limitations, but so did the excel sheet :p.

## Usage
Have each user add their hours in a json file and place it under the shifts directory.
