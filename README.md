# shiftlines
shiftlines is a very simple php app that shows the weekly work scheduals of small teams. I wrote to replace an old excel spreadsheet that we were using to do the samething at work. It has some obvious limitations, but so did the excel sheet :p. 

## Usage
Have each user add their hours in a json file that matches the layout of the example files in the shifts directory and place it in that same directory.
